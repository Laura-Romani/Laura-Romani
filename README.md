# **On the journey to become a _**Python Software engineer**_**
## **Who am I?**
print(Hello World!) - this is not a code! My name is Laura, I am Italian and I am an aspiring Software engineer.
Before I stumbled into the coding world I was (still am) a passionate Zoology graduate who found herself (no special pronouns needed) juggling family life and far away job offers - as a woman/mother in STEM guess what the choice was? Family!
Of course I have no regrets, I have two beautiful children and a wonderful partner; but the love for nature and animals of all kinds, coupled with a strong interest in calculus and statistics has led me to one very big opportunity ------> **Python!**

### **Zoology fun fact**
Do you know which is the longest snake in the world? It is of course a Python.
Specifically, the reticulated Python ***Malayopython reticulatus*** from Southeast Asia. [NHM reticulated Python](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-the-biggest-snake-in-the-world.html)

I hope you enjoyed this Zoology-coding pun. Next...

### **Favourite place I have visited:**
Southern Ireland to Dublin: starting off in Shannon and all the way up to the Cliffs of Moher (pronounced Moor), ending up in the AAran islands via the smallest fishing boat on Earth, full of sea-sick Americans, of course I endured!
In between pub food and live music, passing through Galway hitch-hiking (not reccomended for the fainthearted) and finishing off at a historical airbnb in Dublin (ghost hunted), hopping from pub to pub until my return to London.
Some of the most beautiful landscapes ever seen!

Back to my coding journey...

## **What am I doing here?**
I am currently undergoing a HyperionDev Sofware Engineering (Fundamentals) bootcamp with CoGrammar funded by the Dept. for Education in UK, which is an amazing opportuinity to learn a complete new skillset.
I have therefore created this GitHub account as a first step to become a software engineer. In this account you will find:
- different repositories with task files as I immerse in the bootcamp;
- working progress files used to practice;
- feedback and reviews by my tutors.

## **What softwares am I using?**
I currently have Windows and using Visual Studio Code with Python. As specified Python is my primary language of interest.

### **Final notes**
I welcome feeback and advice of any kind, including how to structure this read.me page.
My project portfolio is also not ready yet ---- watch this space.

Thank you,
Laura
