# **On the journey to become a _**Python Software engineer**_**
## **Who am I?**
print(Hello World!) - this is not a code! My name is Laura and I am an aspiring Software engineer.
Before I stumbled into the coding world I was (still am) a passionate Zoology graduate who found herself (no special pronouns needed) juggling family life and far away job offers - as a woman in STEM guess what the choice was? Family!
of course I have no regrets, I have two beautiful children and a wonderful partner; but the love for nature and animals of all kinds, coupled with a strong interest in calculus and statistics has led me to one very big opportunity ------> **Python!**

### Zoology fun fact
Do you know which is the longest snake in the world? It is of course a Python.
Specifically, the reticulated Python ***Malayopython reticulatus*** from SouthEast Asia. [NHM reticulated Python](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-the-biggest-snake-in-the-world.html)

I hope you enjoyed this Zoology-coding pun. Next...
## **What am I doing here?**
I am currently undergoing a HYperionDEv Sofware Engineering (Fundamentals) bootcamp funded by the D. of Education in UK, which is an amazing opportuinity to learn a complete new skillset.
I have therefore created this GitHub account as a first step to become a software engineer. In this account you will find:
- different repositories with task files as I immerse in the bootcamp;
- working progress files used to practice;
- feedback and reviews by my tutors.

## **What softwares am I using?**
I currently have Windows and using Visual Studio Code with Python. As specified Python is my primary language of interest.

### **Final notes**
I welcome feeback and advice of any kind, including how to structure this read.me page.
My project portfolio is also not ready yet ---- watch this space.

Thank you,
Laura
