# **On the journey to become a _**Python Software engineer**_**
## **Who am I?**
print(Hello World!) - this is not a code! My name is Laura and I am an aspiring Software engineer.
Before I stumbled into the coding world I was (still am) a passionate Zoology graduate who found herself (no special pronouns needed) juggling family life and far away job offers - as a woman in STEM guess what the choice was? Family!
of course I have no regrets, I have two beautiful children and a wonderful partner; but the love for nature and animals of all kinds, coupled with a strong interest in calculus and statistics has led me to one very big opportunity ------> **Python!**

### Zoology fun fact!
Do you know which is the longest snake in the world? it is of course a Python.
Specifically, the reticulated Python ***Malayopython reticulatus*** from SouthEast Asia. [NHM reticulated Python](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-the-biggest-snake-in-the-world.html)
